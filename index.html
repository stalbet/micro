			 <p>So this thing about the smell called ‚Äúzankha‚Äù is going around Twitter. I think I‚Äôve noticed it too!</p>
<p>I never really paid attention to it though. Dunno if I can detect it reliably, maybe gotta do some blind experiments.</p>
<p>Also 23andMe says I‚Äôm 1.2% Levantine. Hmm‚Ä¶ü§î</p>

			 <p>This might seem like a weird connection, but this morning‚Äôs terrorist attack in Jerusalem reminded me of some of my objections to <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2022/12/between-chaos-and-the-man-the-dawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow-the-dispossessed-ursula-k-le-guin/">Alan Jacobs‚Äô recent essay on anarchism</a>. What new is there to say about a terrorist attack? So I‚Äôll talk about this instead.</p>
<p>I think Jacobs slides over objections to anarchism way too glibly. One example is the point about anarchist society being less productive. Discussing Ursula K. LeGuin‚Äôs <em>The Dispossessed</em>, he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy and partly correct to say that the resource-poor environment of Anarres ensured that its residents would live simply; but it is equally true to say that simplicity was what the Odonians preferred. They stood a better chance of adhering to that preference, and of remaining anarchist, on a world that never tempted them with a lush life and (therefore) a more differentiated social order. Ample natural resources and hierarchical political structures‚Äîsuch as existed on Urras, especially in the nation called A-Io‚Äîlead to innovation and productivity; but they also lead to inequality, injustice, and the exploitation of the world and its creatures, including its human creatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every social order comes with trade-offs. The Odonians of Anarres know they have given up comforts that those on Urras would deem necessities. Most of them warmly accept those sacrifices, and indeed don‚Äôt think of them as sacrifices, because they believe themselves to be amply compensated by their freedom and egalitarian social solidarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first thought when I read that a few days ago was that the innovation and productivity he‚Äôs willing to sacrifice don‚Äôt just lead to a ‚Äúlush life.‚Äù They also lead to life-saving and life-enhancing medical technology, for instance.</p>
<p>But today I‚Äôm thinking the important thing is that without hierarchical political structures, we here would have <em>no</em> life: no existence as an independent community at all, and many of us as individuals would be killed. Hierarchical political‚Äìeconomic structures, and the hierarchical military structures that accompany them, are an absolutely crucial condition of our existence.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt my only objection to the essay by any means. But it‚Äôs the one that came to mind after today‚Äôs terrorist attack. Like Jacobs, I also believed in anarchism as a teenager. I read the same books as he did at the same age as he did, so I think I understand where he‚Äôs coming from. But the closer we were to move towards anarchism, the more we would endanger our existence.</p>

			 <p>Some movies I thought were Good Actually (not guilty pleasures) even though they got bad reviews. What are some others? üçø</p>
<p>The Counselor (2013)
Spring Breakers (2013)
Year of the Gun (1991)
This is 40 (2012)</p>
<p>The first two I think lots of film critics simply misunderstood.</p>

			 <p>Interesting <a href="https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-overman-cuts-people-off-in-traffic">post by Richard Hanania on early and late mergers in traffic</a>. He gives three reasons for early merging. The third applies to me: social conformity/cowardice.</p>

			 <p>Here‚Äôs an <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10508-022-02467-5?sharing_token=gTPNUCpXVCqq7WzMU2n7_Pe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5rplxPSeiwUBnON7599x-nN5xQx3FeH6V32q5aqBxbVuS5DPZOVGgLXeaOlOZr6g9AUNJzY-ZzYeSxjDmC8pWV-eEP8Cf6sGBgLDN2wTMUE2QuuKXpbM2Z_ZjOphK9NwI=&amp;error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=f86bdd87-822f-4e1f-aa30-9368441a90dc">interesting article by Harvard biology lecturer Carole Hooven</a> on the hysterical reaction to comments she made about biological sex.</p>
<p>I think Hooven‚Äôs conception of biological sex is wrong philosophically, but there‚Äôs no excuse for the reaction described in the article.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the fundamental issue in the dispute, which is rarely stated explicitly: Hooven claims that her concept of sex, gamete type, is the <em>only</em> legitimate concept of sex. I don‚Äôt think anyone seriously denies that her concept is <em>a</em> legitimate concept of biological sex. Her opponents just argue there are other legitimate sex concepts as well (e.g., chromosomes).</p>
<p>As far as I know, Hooven has never actually defended her claim, except once in her classroom, defending it against Harvard professor Sarah Richardson. Richardson argues for sex contextualism.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, no other scientist or philosopher has defended that ‚Äúmonist‚Äù claim, either in print or on the internet. They just repeatedly assert it without argument.</p>
<p>But none of that matters to the scandal at Harvard that‚Äôs described in the article, and which explains why Hooven is not currently teaching. There‚Äôs no excuse for suppressing her scholarly opinion.</p>

			 <p><em>Ride the High Country</em> (1962, dir. Sam Peckinpah) has gotta be one of the best Westerns ever. One of the few movies where the unequivocally good main character is just as deep and interesting as the morally ambiguous one. In <em>that</em> way even better than <em>The Wild Bunch</em>?üçø</p>
