<p>Biblical narrative is non-fiction because it <em>claims</em> to be true, regardless of whether it is actually true. It&rsquo;s a simple, single criterion.üìö</p>

			 <p>Interesting <a href="https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-overman-cuts-people-off-in-traffic">post by Richard Hanania on early and late mergers in traffic</a>. He gives three reasons for early merging. The third applies to me: social conformity/cowardice.</p>
<p>But what I fear is people <em>wrongly</em> thinking I‚Äôm selfish/antisocial when I haven‚Äôt been, not when I have been.</p>

			 <p>Here‚Äôs an <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10508-022-02467-5?sharing_token=gTPNUCpXVCqq7WzMU2n7_Pe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5rplxPSeiwUBnON7599x-nN5xQx3FeH6V32q5aqBxbVuS5DPZOVGgLXeaOlOZr6g9AUNJzY-ZzYeSxjDmC8pWV-eEP8Cf6sGBgLDN2wTMUE2QuuKXpbM2Z_ZjOphK9NwI=&amp;error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=f86bdd87-822f-4e1f-aa30-9368441a90dc">interesting article by Harvard biology lecturer Carole Hooven</a> on the hysterical reaction to comments she made about biological sex.</p>
<p>I think Hooven‚Äôs conception of biological sex is wrong philosophically, but there‚Äôs no excuse for the reaction described in the article.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the fundamental issue in the dispute, which is rarely stated explicitly: Hooven claims that her concept of sex, gamete type, is the <em>only</em> legitimate concept of sex. I don‚Äôt think anyone seriously denies that her concept is <em>a</em> legitimate concept of biological sex. Her opponents just argue there are other legitimate sex concepts as well (e.g., chromosomes).</p>
<p>As far as I know, Hooven has never actually defended her claim, except once in her classroom, defending it against Harvard professor Sarah Richardson. Richardson argues for sex contextualism.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, no other scientist or philosopher has defended that ‚Äúmonist‚Äù claim, either in print or on the internet. They just repeatedly assert it without argument.</p>
<p>But none of that matters to the scandal at Harvard that‚Äôs described in the article, and which explains why Hooven is not currently teaching. There‚Äôs no excuse for suppressing her scholarly opinion.</p>

			 <p><em>Ride the High Country</em> (1962, dir. Sam Peckinpah) has gotta be one of the best Westerns ever. One of the few movies where the unequivocally good main character is just as deep and interesting as the morally ambiguous one. In <em>that</em> way even better than <em>The Wild Bunch</em>?üçø</p>
