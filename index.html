			 <p>Re last post, here’s how I almost became a settler by accident once.</p>
<p>I was moving to Jerusalem for a year, and I had never been to Israel before, didn’t know anything about it. Someone there in Jerusalem was helping me find an apartment to rent.</p>
<p>She found an apartment for rent in the Jerusalem neighborhood of French Hill. Sounded good, so I decided to rent it. As it happened, the landlords backed out for some reason just before finalizing the agreement. I ended up renting another apartment.</p>
<p>It hadn’t even occurred to me that a “Jerusalem neighborhood” might be over the Green Line, i.e., occupied territory. I probably didn’t even know what the Green Line was. But anyway it was only by chance that I didn’t end up moving into occupied territory and unknowingly become a settler.</p>

<p>Like moving to the outskirts of Jerusalem, because I miss living in Jerusalem so much! But housing is so expensive in Jerusalem inside the Green Line.</p>
<p>I almost became a settler by accident. Now maybe on purpose?</p>

			 <p>🍿 Watched the first half hour of Charade (1963). Guess I’m like the only person in the world who didn’t like the movie (“universal acclaim” on Rotten Tomatoes).</p>
<p>The “witty repartee” between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant was just cringe, like the writer was trying too hard to write 1930s screwball comedy dialogue. And Hepburn and Grant’s delivery of the lines didn’t save them either, surprisingly because Grant had been a great screwball comedy actor. Also he was looking really old.</p>
<p>They seemed to be going for a combination screwball comedy and Hitchcock thriller. I didn’t keep watching long enough to see how well the thriller part was done. But as a witty romcom, I thought that it was a failure.</p>
<p>So that’s my negative review of a movie that everyone loved.</p>

			 <p>This passage from Roger Scruton was <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/the-friendliness-of-objects/">quoted approvingly by Alan Jacobs</a>. I agree with a lot of it, but in the end it strikes me as overly sentimental.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repair (at an earlier stage of our culture) was not so much a habit as an honoured custom. People respected the past of damaged things, restored them as though healing a child and looked on their handiwork with satisfaction. In the act of repair the object was made anew, to occupy the social position of the broken one. Worn shoes went to the anvil, holed socks and unravelled sleeves to the darning last — that peculiar mushroom-shaped object which stood always ready on the mantelpiece.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The custom of repair was not confined to the home. Every town, every village, had its cobbler, its carpenter, its wheelwright and its smith. In each community people supported repairers, who in tum supported things. And our surnames testify to the honour in which their occupations were held. But to where have they repaired, these people who guaranteed the friendliness of objects? With great difficulty you may still find a cobbler — but for the price of his work you could probably buy a new pair of shoes. For the cost of 15 digital watches you may sometimes find a person who will fix the mainspring of your grandfather’s timepiece.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that repair, like every serious social activity, has its ethos, and when that ethos is lost, no amount of slap-dash labour can make up for it. The person who repairs must love the broken object, and must love also the process of repair and all that pertains to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK. Scruton keeps raising the stakes until finally we’re asked to believe that the “person who repairs must love the broken object”. Really? The wife or servant or slave who darns a sock must love the sock?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of good stuff there which Alan Jacobs extends to repairing institutions as well. It’s a good conservative answer to radicals (left and right) who ask rhetorically, “What is there left to conserve?” But sometimes Scruton doesn’t know when to stop, and it’s almost a kind of pathetic fallacy when Jacobs says that “People need things, and things need people.”</p>

			 <p>Watched <em>The Shooting</em> (1966) starring Warren Oates, Millie Perkins, and Jack Nicholson. Screenplay by Carole Eastman, who also co-wrote <em>Five Easy Pieces</em>.  Interesting movie, stays with you long after you’ve watched it. Critics call it “the first existentialist Western”. OK, whatever. 🍿</p>
<p>It’s a very simple revenge story that takes on more and more weight as the story progresses but remains stubbornly mysterious; some of characters’ demands for an explanation accentuate its mystery. By the end, it has a mythic feeling that’s well earned by its almost biblical characterization—sparely depicted characters who have great unseen depth—and by the bare desert through which they travel on their quest.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I buy the climactic ending. Maybe the ending’s too pretentious and Symbolic, or maybe it really works. I just don’t know. But it fits the rest of the movie.</p>
<p>Not many will agree with me on this, but I think this low-budget Western is far superior to the cartoonish and over-praised spaghetti Westerns of the same period.</p>

			 <p>Finally read <em>Class</em> by Paul Fussell. It’s a fun book 📚. The main message I got from it was contempt.</p>
<p>While he feels pity for the “Destitute” and “Bottom Out of Sight”, he’s not very interested in them. He despises the culture of the “Proles”—cheap, kitschy, mass culture—but he doesn’t seem to have anything against them as people. He pities them too, stuck in jobs with the boss breathing down their neck. (Well, except for the “High Proles”, like carpenters.)</p>
<p>The “Middles” are a different story. They’re above the Proles and below the “Upper Middles”. They’re engineers, military officers, middle managers, and the author despises everything about them. He despises their culture, but he also has contempt for them as people: their status anxiety, their need to impress others, their bad taste.</p>
<p>The only class he seems to appreciate to any extent at all is the “Upper Middles”. These are people who’ve earned rather than inherited: elite doctors, lawyers, Wall Street types, professors; sailing, prep schools, Ivy League. He appreciates that they often have taste and an interest in ideas. Still, he’s not overly fond of them.</p>
<p>The “Uppers” don’t interest him much either. They’ve inherited much if not all of their fortune. Unlike the Upper Middles they have bad taste, for example preferring bland, mushy food. They have no interest in art, literature, or ideas.</p>
<p>But it’s his contempt for the “Middles” that really stands out. (Disclosure: I’m a Middle.) He seems to spend more words on them than any other class. His ideal type of Middle is representative in some ways. I’ve known Middles who did display the kind of status anxiety he describes—those ads in the <em>New Yorker</em>, the big vocabulary words—but not all that many Middles are like that in my experience.</p>
<p>Still, his lifestyle descriptions are usually accurate. He quotes another writer about a Middle woman and her recipe for spaghetti bolognese with ground beef, canned tomatoes, and too much oregano. How dare he insult my mother!</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s a snarky, not nice book, but still it’s insightful and lots of fun to read.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://jasonmanning.substack.com/p/books-fragging">Interesting review</a> of a 📕 on “fragging” during the Vietnam War: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0896727157"><em>Fragging: Why U.S. Soldiers Assaulted Their Officers in Vietnam</em></a>. Fragging was usually a result of interpersonal conflicts; typically at a garrison, far from the front; often with a racial element, with some fragging victims chosen solely because of their race.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While there were some cases that resembled the popular image, the majority of confirmed fraggings stemmed from more prosaic interpersonal conflicts. Usually fraggers were angry about acts of discipline directed at them personally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes these sanctions were fairly severe, unusual by the standards of military discipline. For example, one soldier with an otherwise outstanding record killed a superior who, as even fellow officers testified, singled him out for special surveillance and restriction. The officer even attempted to regulate the soldier’s private life, disapproving of the soldier’s Vietnamese wife and going out of his way to keep the soldier from visiting her. This soldier resorted to fragging only after unsuccessful attempts to appeal to other superiors for help with the conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In other cases, though, fragging resulted from completely routine discipline: getting chewed out, busted down, or given punishment duties like cleaning latrines. And in some cases the offense that triggered the fragging was something most outsiders would see as completely trivial: One officer was killed for making a soldier cut his hair, while another got fragged for not handing out a large enough ration of cigarettes (Lepre, p.99).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the usual racial violence between soldiers, there were even violent racial rebellions among soldiers in Vietnam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some cases the pattern was still one of a soldier reacting to some particular grievance against a particular superior, though the grievance involved racial discrimination. In other cases the attacks were more indiscriminate, targeting white officers or soldiers in general. For example:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the evening of 5 February 1970, four black marines of Force Logistic Command’s maintenance battalion decided to kill some ‘beasts’ – white marines. While a music group performed at the unit’s club, two grenades were tossed onto the crowded patio floor. The first failed to explode&hellip;.The second killed Corporal Ronald D. Pate and injured sixty-two others (p.103).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A week later, in the same battalion, a dispute with a superior led one black private to throw a grenade into a hut full of white NCOs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes fragging was even part of a large scale rebellion:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After a black soldier was arrested in Tuy Hoa in August 1971 and charged with aggravated assault, approximately forty-five black troops gathered around the provost marshal’s office and demanded his release. When the man was returned to the custody of his unit for transfer to the stockade, several nights of fragging and arson ensured (p.105).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In an even larger scale rebellion, on August 29, 1968 hundreds of black prisoners at Long Binh Jail overwhelmed the prison guard, captured the stockade commander, and set the administration building and mess hall on fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The military significantly lowered its admission standards during the Vietnam War, and those admitted under the new standards were overrepresented among those committing fragging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another factor leading to more fraggings – and other sorts of conflict and dysfunction – was the caliber of soldier recruited to fight the war. For this was the war of the Pentagon’s Project 100,000 through which the army admitted a large number of men who would previously have failed the mental and physical standards. The result was a lot of soldiers with unusually low cognitive ability (AFQT scores in the 10-30th percentile).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of these men were, by any common definition, mentally disabled – unable to learn to tie their own shoes, to count or to read. Others were just quite dumb, unable to keep straight military ranks and regulations and procedures, leading to frequent problems with their superiors and comrades. In review of a book on Project 100,000, Gwern gives some examples of grievances arising when you throw such men into a military situation:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“He was perpetually angry and aggrieved, and he talked back to the sergeants. When they cursed him and threatened him, he would say angrily, ‘I just wanna go home! Why don’t you let me go home?’”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One mutinied from the drills, under the impression that being sent to the ‘stockade’ meant going home, until it was explained to him that the word meant ‘jail’”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Project 100,000 soldiers also tended to have correlated psychiatric and social problems, including criminal histories that would have disqualified recruits under older standards. One investigation found that the low aptitude men “seemed to have a lower stress tolerance and a relative lack of the usual mechanisms of coping with stress” (p.64). And these soldiers let in under the new standards – who would have been rejected under the old ones – tended to get in more trouble: Their court martial rate was twice that other soldiers (Lepre, p.64). Lepre argues that they contributed disproportionately to the fraggers, who were also more likely to be high school dropouts and tended to come from “broken homes” with “family histories [that] were often so disturbing that the troubling details were offered in mitigation when the men faced military justice” (Lepre, p.69).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, looks like a really interesting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0896727157">book</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here’s a short post (for myself, I don’t expect anyone else to read it) about Ruth Millikan’s concept of proper function. Very roughly: A proper function of something is a function performed by its ancestors that helps explain why that thing exists. So a proper function of a heart is to pump blood. But it seems to me that given the “precariousness of existence” of organisms, the proper function of an individual body part or behavior is pretty insignificant!</p>
<p>In <em>Language, Thought and other Biological Categories</em> Millikan defines a proper function as follows. The definition uses terms she’s defined previously, but you can get the gist of it even without seeing the previous definitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where <em>m</em> is a member of a reproductively established family <em>R</em> and <em>R</em> has the reproductively established or Normal character <em>C, m</em> has the function <em>F</em> as a direct proper function iff:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) Certain ancestors of <em>m</em> performed <em>F</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) In part because there existed a direct causal connection between having the character <em>C</em> and performance of the function <em>F</em> in the case of these ancestors of <em>m</em>, <em>C</em> correlated positively with <em>F</em> over a certain set of items <em>S</em> which included here ancestors and other things not having <em>C</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) One among the legitimate explanations that can be given of the fact that <em>m</em> exists makes reference to the fact that <em>C</em> correlated positively with <em>F</em> over <em>S</em>, either directly causing reproduction or <em>m</em> or explaining why <em>R</em> was proliferated and hence why <em>m</em> exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next paragraph she says that hearts have direct proper functions, provided our guesses about their evolution are correct. Here <em>m</em> would be the heart in a given organism, <em>R</em> I guess would be the family of hearts in the organism’s lineage, <em>F</em> might be pumping blood, and then <em>C</em> would be the reproducible (genetic) properties of members of <em>R</em> that cause (some of) them to pump blood.</p>
<p>The problem I think is in (3). This is where the “precariousness of existence” comes in, as discussed by Derek Parfit and others. A given organism conceived of two gametes is <em>essentially</em> the organism conceived of <em>those very two</em> gametes. Different sperm and egg, different organism. Thus an organism’s existence is “precarious”: if its conception had occurred at any other moment, it would probably have involved a different pair of gametes, hence that individual organism would never have existed.</p>
<p>So if your distant ancestor’s heart had never pumped blood, you wouldn’t exist, so your heart wouldn’t exist either. So far, so good. But what if that distant, ocean-dwelling ancestor’s heart had pumped blood <em>better</em> than it actually did, enough to measurably change that ancestor’s life? Also then, you and your heart very likely wouldn’t exist!</p>
<p>Now consider Millikan’s condition (3) and the correlation of <em>C</em> with <em>F</em>. Yes, the fact that it’s positive explains “why <em>R</em> was proliferated and hence why <em>m</em> exists.” If your ancestors’ hearts had pumped blood less effectively than their evolutionary competitors’, <em>R</em> might not have proliferated. But if the correlation were <em>greater</em> than it actually was, <em>R</em> would have proliferated <em>differently</em> and again, because of the “precariousness of existence”, you and your heart would not exist.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s not only the fact that (roughly speaking) <em>C</em> has caused <em>F</em> per se that explains <em>m</em>’s existence. That’s a true partial explanation but a misleading one. It’s rather the fact that <em>C</em> correlated with <em>F</em> <em>exactly</em> as it actually did, not worse and <em>not better</em> either! So the explanation in condition (3) seems true but insignificantly so, because of the precariousness of <em>m</em>’s existence.</p>

			 <p>This is well said by Chantal Mouffe on the “good democrats” who substitute moralizing for politics in their response to what they call the “extreme right”. Published in 2005, obviously drawing on Carl Schmitt, still very relevant today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we saw earlier, the dominant discourse announces the end of the adversarial model of politics and the advent of a consensual politics beyond left and right. However, politics always entails an us/ them distinction. This is why the consensus advocated by the defenders of the ‘non-partisan democracy’ cannot exist without drawing a frontier and defining an exterior, a &lsquo;them&rsquo; which assures the identity of the consensus and secures the coherence of the ‘us'. To put it in another way, the consensus at the centre, which is supposed to include everybody in our post-political societies, cannot exist without the establishment of a frontier, because no consensus - or no common identity, for that matter - can exist without a frontier. There cannot be an &lsquo;us&rsquo; without a &lsquo;them&rsquo;, and the very identity of a group depends on the existence of a &lsquo;constitutive outside’. So the us of the ‘good democrats&rsquo; needs to be secured by the determination of a &lsquo;them&rsquo;. Nowadays the ‘them' is provided by what is designated as the &lsquo;extreme right’. This term is used in a very undefined way to refer to an amalgam of groups and parties whose characteristics and objectives are extremely diverse and it covers a wide spectrum which goes from fringe groups of extremists, skinheads and neo-nazis to the authoritarian right and a variety of right-wing populist parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such a heterogeneous construct is of course useless to grasp the nature and causes of the new forms of right-wing politics. But it is very useful to secure the identity of the &lsquo;good democrats’ and to procure a positive image of the post-political consensus. It is clear that, since politics has supposedly become &lsquo;non-adversarial&rsquo;, the &lsquo;them&rsquo; which is necessary to make possible the &lsquo;us&rsquo; of the good democrats cannot be envisaged as a political adversary, and the frontier has to be drawn in the moral register. So, to draw the frontier between the &lsquo;good democrats and the &lsquo;evil extreme-right&rsquo; is very convenient, since the them&rsquo; can now be considered as a sort of moral disease which needs to be condemned morally, not fought politically. This is why no attempt is made to try to understand the reasons for its existence - an understanding, in any case, made impossible by the amalgam on which the very notion of &lsquo;extreme-right&rsquo; is based. Moreover, attempts at understanding are deemed suspect, and perceived as a move towards condoning something which is morally unacceptable. As a consequence, moral condemnation and the establishment of a cordon sanitaire have become the dominant answers to the rise of right-wing populist movements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The increasing moralisation of political discourse that we are witnessing goes hand in hand with the dominant post-political perspective. Far from indicating a new stage in the triumphant march of democracy, such a phenomenon represents a very negative development. Let&rsquo;s not misunderstand my point. It is not my intention to defend Realpolitik and to deny that normative concerns should play a role in politics. But there is a big difference between morality and moralism, which limits itself to the denunciation of evil in others. Yet today&rsquo;s good democrats are so confident that they have the truth, and that their mission is to impose it on others, that they refuse to engage in debate with those who disagree.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is no doubt easier to present them as a moral enemy, to be destroyed and eradicated, instead of having to envisage them as adversaries in the political terrain.</p>

			 <p>This might seem like a weird connection, but this morning’s terrorist attack in Jerusalem reminded me of some of my objections to <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2022/12/between-chaos-and-the-man-the-dawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow-the-dispossessed-ursula-k-le-guin/">Alan Jacobs’ recent essay on anarchism</a>. What new is there to say about a terrorist attack? So I’ll talk about this instead.</p>
<p>I think Jacobs slides over objections to anarchism way too glibly. One example is the point about anarchist society being less productive. Discussing Ursula K. LeGuin’s <em>The Dispossessed</em>, he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy and partly correct to say that the resource-poor environment of Anarres ensured that its residents would live simply; but it is equally true to say that simplicity was what the Odonians preferred. They stood a better chance of adhering to that preference, and of remaining anarchist, on a world that never tempted them with a lush life and (therefore) a more differentiated social order. Ample natural resources and hierarchical political structures—such as existed on Urras, especially in the nation called A-Io—lead to innovation and productivity; but they also lead to inequality, injustice, and the exploitation of the world and its creatures, including its human creatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every social order comes with trade-offs. The Odonians of Anarres know they have given up comforts that those on Urras would deem necessities. Most of them warmly accept those sacrifices, and indeed don’t think of them as sacrifices, because they believe themselves to be amply compensated by their freedom and egalitarian social solidarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first thought when I read that a few days ago was that the innovation and productivity he’s willing to sacrifice don’t just lead to a “lush life.” They also lead to life-saving and life-enhancing medical technology, for instance.</p>
<p>But today I’m thinking the important thing is that without hierarchical political structures, we here would have <em>no</em> life: no existence as an independent community at all, and many of us as individuals would be killed. Hierarchical political–economic structures, and the hierarchical military structures that accompany them, are an absolutely crucial condition of our existence.</p>
<p>This isn’t my only objection to the essay by any means. But it’s the one that came to mind after today’s terrorist attack. Like Jacobs, I also believed in anarchism as a teenager. I read the same books as he did at the same age as he did, so I think I understand where he’s coming from. But the closer we were to move towards anarchism, the more we would endanger our existence.</p>

<p>The Counselor (2013)
Spring Breakers (2013)
Year of the Gun (1991)
This is 40 (2012)</p>

<p>I think Hooven’s conception of biological sex is wrong philosophically, but there’s no excuse for the reaction described in the article.</p>
<p>Here’s the fundamental issue in the dispute, which is rarely stated explicitly: Hooven claims that her concept of sex, gamete type, is the <em>only</em> legitimate concept of sex. I don’t think anyone seriously denies that her concept is <em>a</em> legitimate concept of biological sex. Her opponents just argue there are other legitimate sex concepts as well (e.g., chromosomes).</p>
<p>As far as I know, Hooven has never actually defended her claim, except once in her classroom, defending it against Harvard professor Sarah Richardson. Richardson argues for sex contextualism.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, no other scientist or philosopher has defended that “monist” claim, either in print or on the internet. They just repeatedly assert it without argument.</p>
<p>But none of that matters to the scandal at Harvard that’s described in the article, and which explains why Hooven is not currently teaching. There’s no excuse for suppressing her scholarly opinion.</p>
