			 <p>This is well said by Chantal Mouffe on the “good democrats” who substitute moralizing for politics in their response to what they call the “extreme right”. Published in 2005, obviously drawing on Carl Schmitt, still very relevant today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we saw earlier, the dominant discourse announces the end of the adversarial model of politics and the advent of a consensual politics beyond left and right. However, politics always entails an us/ them distinction. This is why the consensus advocated by the defenders of the ‘non-partisan democracy’ cannot exist without drawing a frontier and defining an exterior, a &lsquo;them&rsquo; which assures the identity of the consensus and secures the coherence of the ‘us'. To put it in another way, the consensus at the centre, which is supposed to include everybody in our post-political societies, cannot exist without the establishment of a frontier, because no consensus - or no common identity, for that matter - can exist without a frontier. There cannot be an &lsquo;us&rsquo; without a &lsquo;them&rsquo;, and the very identity of a group depends on the existence of a &lsquo;constitutive outside’. So the us of the ‘good democrats&rsquo; needs to be secured by the determination of a &lsquo;them&rsquo;. Nowadays the ‘them' is provided by what is designated as the &lsquo;extreme right’. This term is used in a very undefined way to refer to an amalgam of groups and parties whose characteristics and objectives are extremely diverse and it covers a wide spectrum which goes from fringe groups of extremists, skinheads and neo-nazis to the authoritarian right and a variety of right-wing populist parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such a heterogeneous construct is of course useless to grasp the nature and causes of the new forms of right-wing politics. But it is very useful to secure the identity of the &lsquo;good democrats’ and to procure a positive image of the post-political consensus. It is clear that, since politics has supposedly become &lsquo;non-adversarial&rsquo;, the &lsquo;them&rsquo; which is necessary to make possible the &lsquo;us&rsquo; of the good democrats cannot be envisaged as a political adversary, and the frontier has to be drawn in the moral register. So, to draw the frontier between the &lsquo;good democrats and the &lsquo;evil extreme-right&rsquo; is very convenient, since the them&rsquo; can now be considered as a sort of moral disease which needs to be condemned morally, not fought politically. This is why no attempt is made to try to understand the reasons for its existence - an understanding, in any case, made impossible by the amalgam on which the very notion of &lsquo;extreme-right&rsquo; is based. Moreover, attempts at understanding are deemed suspect, and perceived as a move towards condoning something which is morally unacceptable. As a consequence, moral condemnation and the establishment of a cordon sanitaire have become the dominant answers to the rise of right-wing populist movements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The increasing moralisation of political discourse that we are witnessing goes hand in hand with the dominant post-political perspective. Far from indicating a new stage in the triumphant march of democracy, such a phenomenon represents a very negative development. Let&rsquo;s not misunderstand my point. It is not my intention to defend Realpolitik and to deny that normative concerns should play a role in politics. But there is a big difference between morality and moralism, which limits itself to the denunciation of evil in others. Yet today&rsquo;s good democrats are so confident that they have the truth, and that their mission is to impose it on others, that they refuse to engage in debate with those who disagree.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is no doubt easier to present them as a moral enemy, to be destroyed and eradicated, instead of having to envisage them as adversaries in the political terrain.</p>

			 <p>So this thing about the smell called “zankha” is going around Twitter. I think I’ve noticed it too!</p>
<p>I never really paid attention to it though. Dunno if I can detect it reliably, maybe gotta do some blind experiments.</p>

			 <p>This might seem like a weird connection, but this morning’s terrorist attack in Jerusalem reminded me of some of my objections to <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2022/12/between-chaos-and-the-man-the-dawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow-the-dispossessed-ursula-k-le-guin/">Alan Jacobs’ recent essay on anarchism</a>. What new is there to say about a terrorist attack? So I’ll talk about this instead.</p>
<p>I think Jacobs slides over objections to anarchism way too glibly. One example is the point about anarchist society being less productive. Discussing Ursula K. LeGuin’s <em>The Dispossessed</em>, he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy and partly correct to say that the resource-poor environment of Anarres ensured that its residents would live simply; but it is equally true to say that simplicity was what the Odonians preferred. They stood a better chance of adhering to that preference, and of remaining anarchist, on a world that never tempted them with a lush life and (therefore) a more differentiated social order. Ample natural resources and hierarchical political structures—such as existed on Urras, especially in the nation called A-Io—lead to innovation and productivity; but they also lead to inequality, injustice, and the exploitation of the world and its creatures, including its human creatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every social order comes with trade-offs. The Odonians of Anarres know they have given up comforts that those on Urras would deem necessities. Most of them warmly accept those sacrifices, and indeed don’t think of them as sacrifices, because they believe themselves to be amply compensated by their freedom and egalitarian social solidarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first thought when I read that a few days ago was that the innovation and productivity he’s willing to sacrifice don’t just lead to a “lush life.” They also lead to life-saving and life-enhancing medical technology, for instance.</p>
<p>But today I’m thinking the important thing is that without hierarchical political structures, we here would have <em>no</em> life: no existence as an independent community at all, and many of us as individuals would be killed. Hierarchical political–economic structures, and the hierarchical military structures that accompany them, are an absolutely crucial condition of our existence.</p>
<p>This isn’t my only objection to the essay by any means. But it’s the one that came to mind after today’s terrorist attack. Like Jacobs, I also believed in anarchism as a teenager. I read the same books as he did at the same age as he did, so I think I understand where he’s coming from. But the closer we were to move towards anarchism, the more we would endanger our existence.</p>

			 <p>Some movies I thought were Good Actually (not guilty pleasures) even though they got bad reviews. What are some others? 🍿</p>
<p>The Counselor (2013)
Spring Breakers (2013)
Year of the Gun (1991)
This is 40 (2012)</p>
<p>The first two I think lots of film critics simply misunderstood.</p>

			 <p>Interesting <a href="https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-overman-cuts-people-off-in-traffic">post by Richard Hanania on early and late mergers in traffic</a>. He gives three reasons for early merging. The third applies to me: social conformity/cowardice.</p>

			 <p>Here’s an <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10508-022-02467-5?sharing_token=gTPNUCpXVCqq7WzMU2n7_Pe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5rplxPSeiwUBnON7599x-nN5xQx3FeH6V32q5aqBxbVuS5DPZOVGgLXeaOlOZr6g9AUNJzY-ZzYeSxjDmC8pWV-eEP8Cf6sGBgLDN2wTMUE2QuuKXpbM2Z_ZjOphK9NwI=&amp;error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=f86bdd87-822f-4e1f-aa30-9368441a90dc">interesting article by Harvard biology lecturer Carole Hooven</a> on the hysterical reaction to comments she made about biological sex.</p>
<p>I think Hooven’s conception of biological sex is wrong philosophically, but there’s no excuse for the reaction described in the article.</p>
<p>Here’s the fundamental issue in the dispute, which is rarely stated explicitly: Hooven claims that her concept of sex, gamete type, is the <em>only</em> legitimate concept of sex. I don’t think anyone seriously denies that her concept is <em>a</em> legitimate concept of biological sex. Her opponents just argue there are other legitimate sex concepts as well (e.g., chromosomes).</p>
<p>As far as I know, Hooven has never actually defended her claim, except once in her classroom, defending it against Harvard professor Sarah Richardson. Richardson argues for sex contextualism.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, no other scientist or philosopher has defended that “monist” claim, either in print or on the internet. They just repeatedly assert it without argument.</p>
<p>But none of that matters to the scandal at Harvard that’s described in the article, and which explains why Hooven is not currently teaching. There’s no excuse for suppressing her scholarly opinion.</p>

			 <p><em>Ride the High Country</em> (1962, dir. Sam Peckinpah) has gotta be one of the best Westerns ever.
