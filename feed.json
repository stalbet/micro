				"content_html": "<p>This is well said by Chantal Mouffe on the ‚Äúgood democrats‚Äù who substitute moralizing for politics in their response to what they call the ‚Äúextreme right‚Äù. Published in 2005, obviously drawing on Carl Schmitt, still very relevant today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we saw earlier, the dominant discourse announces the end of the adversarial model of politics and the advent of a consensual politics beyond left and right. However, politics always entails an us/ them distinction. This is why the consensus advocated by the defenders of the ‚Äònon-partisan democracy‚Äô cannot exist without drawing a frontier and defining an exterior, a &lsquo;them&rsquo; which assures the identity of the consensus and secures the coherence of the ‚Äòus'. To put it in another way, the consensus at the centre, which is supposed to include everybody in our post-political societies, cannot exist without the establishment of a frontier, because no consensus - or no common identity, for that matter - can exist without a frontier. There cannot be an &lsquo;us&rsquo; without a &lsquo;them&rsquo;, and the very identity of a group depends on the existence of a &lsquo;constitutive outside‚Äô. So the us of the ‚Äògood democrats&rsquo; needs to be secured by the determination of a &lsquo;them&rsquo;. Nowadays the ‚Äòthem' is provided by what is designated as the &lsquo;extreme right‚Äô. This term is used in a very undefined way to refer to an amalgam of groups and parties whose characteristics and objectives are extremely diverse and it covers a wide spectrum which goes from fringe groups of extremists, skinheads and neo-nazis to the authoritarian right and a variety of right-wing populist parties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Such a heterogeneous construct is of course useless to grasp the nature and causes of the new forms of right-wing politics. But it is very useful to secure the identity of the &lsquo;good democrats‚Äô and to procure a positive image of the post-political consensus. It is clear that, since politics has supposedly become &lsquo;non-adversarial&rsquo;, the &lsquo;them&rsquo; which is necessary to make possible the &lsquo;us&rsquo; of the good democrats cannot be envisaged as a political adversary, and the frontier has to be drawn in the moral register. So, to draw the frontier between the &lsquo;good democrats and the &lsquo;evil extreme-right&rsquo; is very convenient, since the them&rsquo; can now be considered as a sort of moral disease which needs to be condemned morally, not fought politically. This is why no attempt is made to try to understand the reasons for its existence - an understanding, in any case, made impossible by the amalgam on which the very notion of &lsquo;extreme-right&rsquo; is based. Moreover, attempts at understanding are deemed suspect, and perceived as a move towards condoning something which is morally unacceptable. As a consequence, moral condemnation and the establishment of a cordon sanitaire have become the dominant answers to the rise of right-wing populist movements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The increasing moralisation of political discourse that we are witnessing goes hand in hand with the dominant post-political perspective. Far from indicating a new stage in the triumphant march of democracy, such a phenomenon represents a very negative development. Let&rsquo;s not misunderstand my point. It is not my intention to defend Realpolitik and to deny that normative concerns should play a role in politics. But there is a big difference between morality and moralism, which limits itself to the denunciation of evil in others. Yet today&rsquo;s good democrats are so confident that they have the truth, and that their mission is to impose it on others, that they refuse to engage in debate with those who disagree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is no doubt easier to present them as a moral enemy, to be destroyed and eradicated, instead of having to envisage them as adversaries in the political terrain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
