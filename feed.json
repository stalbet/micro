I agree with a lot of it, but in the end it strikes me as overly sentimental.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Repair (at an earlier stage of our culture) was not so much a habit as an honoured custom. People respected the past of damaged things, restored them as though healing a child and looked on their handiwork with satisfaction. In the act of repair the object was made anew, to occupy the social position of the broken one. Worn shoes went to the anvil, holed socks and unravelled sleeves to the darning last — that peculiar mushroom-shaped object which stood always ready on the mantelpiece.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The custom of repair was not confined to the home. Every town, every village, had its cobbler, its carpenter, its wheelwright and its smith. In each community people supported repairers, who in tum supported things. And our surnames testify to the honour in which their occupations were held. But to where have they repaired, these people who guaranteed the friendliness of objects? With great difficulty you may still find a cobbler — but for the price of his work you could probably buy a new pair of shoes. For the cost of 15 digital watches you may sometimes find a person who will fix the mainspring of your grandfather’s timepiece.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The truth is that repair, like every serious social activity, has its ethos, and when that ethos is lost, no amount of slap-dash labour can make up for it. The person who repairs must love the broken object, and must love also the process of repair and all that pertains to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OK. Scruton keeps raising the stakes until finally we’re asked to believe that the “person who repairs must love the broken object”. Really? The wife or servant or slave who darns a sock must love the sock?</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of good stuff there which Alan Jacobs extends to repairing institutions as well. It’s a good conservative answer to radicals (left and right) who ask rhetorically, “What is there left to conserve?” But sometimes Scruton doesn’t know when to stop, and it’s almost a kind of pathetic fallacy when Jacobs says that “People need things, and things need people.”</p>\n",

Fragging was usually a result of interpersonal conflicts; typically at a garrison, far from the front; often with a racial element, with some fragging victims chosen solely because of their race.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While there were some cases that resembled the popular image, the majority of confirmed fraggings stemmed from more prosaic interpersonal conflicts. Usually fraggers were angry about acts of discipline directed at them personally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes these sanctions were fairly severe, unusual by the standards of military discipline. For example, one soldier with an otherwise outstanding record killed a superior who, as even fellow officers testified, singled him out for special surveillance and restriction. The officer even attempted to regulate the soldier’s private life, disapproving of the soldier’s Vietnamese wife and going out of his way to keep the soldier from visiting her. This soldier resorted to fragging only after unsuccessful attempts to appeal to other superiors for help with the conflict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other cases, though, fragging resulted from completely routine discipline: getting chewed out, busted down, or given punishment duties like cleaning latrines. And in some cases the offense that triggered the fragging was something most outsiders would see as completely trivial: One officer was killed for making a soldier cut his hair, while another got fragged for not handing out a large enough ration of cigarettes (Lepre, p.99).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beyond the usual racial violence between soldiers, there were even violent racial rebellions among soldiers in Vietnam:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In some cases the pattern was still one of a soldier reacting to some particular grievance against a particular superior, though the grievance involved racial discrimination. In other cases the attacks were more indiscriminate, targeting white officers or soldiers in general. For example:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the evening of 5 February 1970, four black marines of Force Logistic Command’s maintenance battalion decided to kill some ‘beasts’ – white marines. While a music group performed at the unit’s club, two grenades were tossed onto the crowded patio floor. The first failed to explode&hellip;.The second killed Corporal Ronald D. Pate and injured sixty-two others (p.103).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A week later, in the same battalion, a dispute with a superior led one black private to throw a grenade into a hut full of white NCOs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes fragging was even part of a large scale rebellion:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After a black soldier was arrested in Tuy Hoa in August 1971 and charged with aggravated assault, approximately forty-five black troops gathered around the provost marshal’s office and demanded his release. When the man was returned to the custody of his unit for transfer to the stockade, several nights of fragging and arson ensured (p.105).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In an even larger scale rebellion, on August 29, 1968 hundreds of black prisoners at Long Binh Jail overwhelmed the prison guard, captured the stockade commander, and set the administration building and mess hall on fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The military significantly lowered its admission standards during the Vietnam War, and those admitted under the new standards were overrepresented among those committing fragging.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another factor leading to more fraggings – and other sorts of conflict and dysfunction – was the caliber of soldier recruited to fight the war. For this was the war of the Pentagon’s Project 100,000 through which the army admitted a large number of men who would previously have failed the mental and physical standards. The result was a lot of soldiers with unusually low cognitive ability (AFQT scores in the 10-30th percentile).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of these men were, by any common definition, mentally disabled – unable to learn to tie their own shoes, to count or to read. Others were just quite dumb, unable to keep straight military ranks and regulations and procedures, leading to frequent problems with their superiors and comrades. In review of a book on Project 100,000, Gwern gives some examples of grievances arising when you throw such men into a military situation:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He was perpetually angry and aggrieved, and he talked back to the sergeants. When they cursed him and threatened him, he would say angrily, ‘I just wanna go home! Why don’t you let me go home?’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“One mutinied from the drills, under the impression that being sent to the ‘stockade’ meant going home, until it was explained to him that the word meant ‘jail’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Project 100,000 soldiers also tended to have correlated psychiatric and social problems, including criminal histories that would have disqualified recruits under older standards. One investigation found that the low aptitude men “seemed to have a lower stress tolerance and a relative lack of the usual mechanisms of coping with stress” (p.64). And these soldiers let in under the new standards – who would have been rejected under the old ones – tended to get in more trouble: Their court martial rate was twice that other soldiers (Lepre, p.64). Lepre argues that they contributed disproportionately to the fraggers, who were also more likely to be high school dropouts and tended to come from “broken homes” with “family histories [that] were often so disturbing that the troubling details were offered in mitigation when the men faced military justice” (Lepre, p.69).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, looks like a really interesting <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0896727157\">book</a>.</p>\n",

When the man was returned to the custody of his unit for transfer to the stockade, several nights of fragging and arson ensured (p.105).\n\n> In an even larger scale rebellion, on August 29, 1968 hundreds of black prisoners at Long Binh Jail overwhelmed the prison guard, captured the stockade commander, and set the administration building and mess hall on fire.\n\nThe military significantly lowered its admission standards during the Vietnam War, and those admitted under the new standards were overrepresented among those committing fragging.\n\n> Another factor leading to more fraggings – and other sorts of conflict and dysfunction – was the caliber of soldier recruited to fight the war. For this was the war of the Pentagon’s Project 100,000 through which the army admitted a large number of men who would previously have failed the mental and physical standards. The result was a lot of soldiers with unusually low cognitive ability (AFQT scores in the 10-30th percentile).\n\n> Some of these men were, by any common definition, mentally disabled – unable to learn to tie their own shoes, to count or to read. Others were just quite dumb, unable to keep straight military ranks and regulations and procedures, leading to frequent problems with their superiors and comrades. In review of a book on Project 100,000, Gwern gives some examples of grievances arising when you throw such men into a military situation:\n\n>> “He was perpetually angry and aggrieved, and he talked back to the sergeants. When they cursed him and threatened him, he would say angrily, ‘I just wanna go home! Why don’t you let me go home?’”\n\n>> “One mutinied from the drills, under the impression that being sent to the ‘stockade’ meant going home, until it was explained to him that the word meant ‘jail’”\n\n> The Project 100,000 soldiers also tended to have correlated psychiatric and social problems, including criminal histories that would have disqualified recruits under older standards. One investigation found that the low aptitude men “seemed to have a lower stress tolerance and a relative lack of the usual mechanisms of coping with stress” (p.64). And these soldiers let in under the new standards – who would have been rejected under the old ones – tended to get in more trouble: Their court martial rate was twice that other soldiers (Lepre, p.64). Lepre argues that they contributed disproportionately to the fraggers, who were also more likely to be high school dropouts and tended to come from “broken homes” with “family histories [that] were often so disturbing that the troubling details were offered in mitigation when the men faced military justice” (Lepre, p.69).\n\nAnyway, looks like a really interesting [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0896727157).\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This might seem like a weird connection, but this morning’s terrorist attack in Jerusalem reminded me of some of my objections to <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2022/12/between-chaos-and-the-man-the-dawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow-the-dispossessed-ursula-k-le-guin/\">Alan Jacobs’ recent essay on anarchism</a>. What new is there to say about a terrorist attack? So I’ll talk about this instead.</p>\n<p>I think Jacobs slides over objections to anarchism way too glibly. One example is the point about anarchist society being less productive. Discussing Ursula K. LeGuin’s <em>The Dispossessed</em>, he writes,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is easy and partly correct to say that the resource-poor environment of Anarres ensured that its residents would live simply; but it is equally true to say that simplicity was what the Odonians preferred. They stood a better chance of adhering to that preference, and of remaining anarchist, on a world that never tempted them with a lush life and (therefore) a more differentiated social order. Ample natural resources and hierarchical political structures—such as existed on Urras, especially in the nation called A-Io—lead to innovation and productivity; but they also lead to inequality, injustice, and the exploitation of the world and its creatures, including its human creatures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every social order comes with trade-offs. The Odonians of Anarres know they have given up comforts that those on Urras would deem necessities. Most of them warmly accept those sacrifices, and indeed don’t think of them as sacrifices, because they believe themselves to be amply compensated by their freedom and egalitarian social solidarity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My first thought when I read that a few days ago was that the innovation and productivity he’s willing to sacrifice don’t just lead to a “lush life.” They also lead to life-saving and life-enhancing medical technology, for instance.</p>\n<p>But today I’m thinking the important thing is that without hierarchical political structures, we here would have <em>no</em> life: no existence as an independent community at all, and many of us as individuals would be killed. Hierarchical political–economic structures, and the hierarchical military structures that accompany them, are an absolutely crucial condition of our existence.</p>\n<p>This isn’t my only objection to the essay by any means.

				"content_text": "This might seem like a weird connection, but this morning’s terrorist attack in Jerusalem reminded me of some of my objections to [Alan Jacobs’ recent essay on anarchism](https://harpers.org/archive/2022/12/between-chaos-and-the-man-the-dawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow-the-dispossessed-ursula-k-le-guin/). What new is there to say about a terrorist attack? So I’ll talk about this instead.\n\nI think Jacobs slides over objections to anarchism way too glibly. One example is the point about anarchist society being less productive. Discussing Ursula K. LeGuin’s _The Dispossessed_, he writes,\n\n> It is easy and partly correct to say that the resource-poor environment of Anarres ensured that its residents would live simply; but it is equally true to say that simplicity was what the Odonians preferred. They stood a better chance of adhering to that preference, and of remaining anarchist, on a world that never tempted them with a lush life and (therefore) a more differentiated social order. Ample natural resources and hierarchical political structures—such as existed on Urras, especially in the nation called A-Io—lead to innovation and productivity; but they also lead to inequality, injustice, and the exploitation of the world and its creatures, including its human creatures.\n\n> Every social order comes with trade-offs. The Odonians of Anarres know they have given up comforts that those on Urras would deem necessities. Most of them warmly accept those sacrifices, and indeed don’t think of them as sacrifices, because they believe themselves to be amply compensated by their freedom and egalitarian social solidarity. \n\nMy first thought when I read that a few days ago was that the innovation and productivity he’s willing to sacrifice don’t just lead to a “lush life.” They also lead to life-saving and life-enhancing medical technology, for instance.\n\nBut today I’m thinking the important thing is that without hierarchical political structures, we here would have _no_ life: no existence as an independent community at all, and many of us as individuals would be killed. Hierarchical political–economic structures, and the hierarchical military structures that accompany them, are an absolutely crucial condition of our existence.\n\nThis isn’t my only objection to the essay by any means. But it’s the one that came to mind after today’s terrorist attack. Like Jacobs, I also believed in anarchism as a teenager. I read the same books as he did at the same age as he did, so I think I understand where he’s coming from. But the closer we were to move towards anarchism, the more we would endanger our existence.\n",
